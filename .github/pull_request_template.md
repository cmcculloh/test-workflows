# Description

    Should begin with a link to a project management ticket or "NO TICKET", eg: [TICKET123](https://jira.company.com/jira/browse/TICKET123)
    Should reference any relevant GH issues, eg: Closes #25
    Should explain what and why changes were made, but not how*
        The code explains _how_ all of this was done, so re-stating it is redundant
    If more than one thing is being accomplished, create a concise bullet-point list stating what the PR accomplishes
    State the reasoning behind decisions that were made. Especially if the "why" isn't obvious, or if answering the question, "Why did you do it _this_ way instead of _this more common_ way?"
    Include a link dump of relevant reference materials you utilized during development

*If for some reason the how is unavoidably confusing, it is recommended that you add the most concise comments possible in your code. Future developers looking at it asking "how??" are unlikely to look at PR descriptions to answer this question.

## Example Description

```
[JIRATicket](https://jira.kroger.com/jira/browse/)
Relates to #25

- Adds a PR template
- Adds DEV_NOTES.md to track ADRs (Architectural Design Rationales) starting with why we chose not to go with Conventional Commits

Right now our PRs are all over the place. Titles and descriptions vary wildly and often the first comment is asking a clarifying question or requesting a JIRA ticket number. This hopes to resolve that and get some consistency.
